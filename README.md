# Streamlit Modal 

Streamlit is an open-source app framework used to create beautiful web apps for machine learning and data science projects. While Streamlit provides many built-in features, it does not natively support modal dialogs. However, you can create modal dialogs using custom HTML and JavaScript.

# What is a Modal?

A modal is a dialog box or a popup window that is displayed on top of the current page. It is commonly used for:

- **Displaying Forms:** Collecting user input without navigating away from the current page.
  
- **Showing Alerts or Notifications:** Informing users about important information or actions that need their attention.
  
- **Providing Additional Information:** Offering more details or context without cluttering the main UI.

Modals enhance user interaction by providing a way to present information or capture user input in a focused manner, without requiring a full page reload or navigation.

# Why Use Modals in Streamlit?

Although Streamlit does not natively support modals, using modals in your Streamlit applications can provide several benefits:

- **Improved User Experience:** Modals allow users to interact with forms or dialogs without leaving the current page, making the experience more seamless and efficient.
  
- **Focused Interaction:** By popping up over the main content, modals keep the user's attention on the task at hand, such as filling out a form or reading a notification.
  
- **Versatility:** Modals can be used for a variety of purposes, including displaying messages, collecting input, or providing additional context, making your application more dynamic and interactive.
